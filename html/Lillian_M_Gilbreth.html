            Lillian Evelyn Moller Gilbreth (May 24, 1878 – January 2, 1972) was described as <em>“a genius in the art of living.”</em> One of the first working female engineers holding a Ph.D., she is held to be the first true industrial/organizational psychologist. She and her husband Frank Bunker Gilbreth, Sr. were efficiency experts who contributed to the study of industrial engineering in fields such as motion study and human factors.

          <p>According to the American Society for Mechanical Engineers, "It was as the role model for the highly intelligent,<br> quirky mother in the popular movie <em>Cheaper by the Dozen</em> that she is probably most widely known."</p> <!---I couldn't find a direct quote from Gilbreth, just about her.--->

        <h3>Interesting Facts</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Lillian Gilbreth graduated from the University of California in 1900 with a bachelor's degree in English literature and was the first female commencement speaker at the university. She earned a Ph.D in psychology in 1915 from Brown University. She was the first of the pioneers of industrial management to receive a doctorate.</li>
                <li>Gilbreth became the first American engineer ever to create a synthesis of psychology and scientific management, helping industrial engineers see the importance of the psychological dimensions of work. She is credited with the invention of both the foot pedal trash can, the shelves on the inside of refrigerator doors (including the butter tray and egg keeper), and wall light switches – all now standard.</li>
                <li>The books <strong>Cheaper by the Dozen</strong> and <strong>Belles on Their Toes</strong> (written by her children Ernestine and Frank Jr.) tell the story of the Gilbreth family life with the twelve children, and describe how Lillian and Frank applied their interest in time and motion study to the organization and daily activities of such a large family. Both books were later made into feature films.</li>
                <li>In 1984, the United States Postal Service issued a 40¢ Great Americans series postage stamp in Gilbreth's honor, and she was lauded by the American Psychological Association as the first psychologist to be so commemorated.</li>
